#A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. 
#A square matrix mat (n*n) is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person.
#You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexin

class Solution:
    def celebrity(self, mat):
        # code here
         n = len(mat)
         candidate = 0

        
         for i in range(1,n):
            if mat[candidate][i] == 1:
                candidate = i  

         for i in range(n):
            if i != candidate:
                if mat[candidate][i] == 1 or mat[i][candidate] == 0:
                    return -1  

         return candidate
