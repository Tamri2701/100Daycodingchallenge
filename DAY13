#Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x, insert that value x at the end of the LinkedList and return the modified Linked List.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5 , x = 6
Output: 1->2->3->4->5->6
We can see that 6 is inserted at the end of the linkedlist.


class Solution:
    #Function to insert a node at the end of the linked list.
    def insertAtEnd(self,head,x):
        # code here 
        new_node = Node(x)
        

        if head is None:
            return new_node
       
        temp = head
        while temp.next:
            temp = temp.next
   
        temp.next = new_node
        
        return head
