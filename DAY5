Given an unsorted array arr of positive integers. One number a from the set [1, 2,....,n] is missing and one number b occurs twice in the array. Find numbers a and b.

Note: The test cases are generated such that there always exists one missing and one repeating number within the range [1,n].


class Solution:
    def findTwoElement( self,arr): 
        # code here
        n = len(arr)
        count = [0] * (n + 1)  


        for num in arr:
         count[num] += 1

        repeating = missing = -1


        for i in range(1, n + 1):
          if count[i] == 2:
            repeating = i
          elif count[i] == 0:
            missing = i

        return [repeating, missing]
