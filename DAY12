#Given the head of a linked list, the task is to reverse this list and return the reversed head.

Examples:

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
Output: head: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head):
        # Code here
        prev = None
        current = head

        while current:
            next_node = current.next  
            current.next = prev      
            prev = current            
            current = next_node       

        return prev  


def printLinkedList(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("NULL")
