# Given two arrays a[] and b[] of equal size, the task is to find whether the elements in the arrays are equal.

class Solution:
    # Function to check if two arrays are equal or not.
    def checkEqual(self, a, b) -> bool:
        #code here
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
   
        return a == b

#You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
#This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, arr):
        # code here

     n = len(arr) + 1
     expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  
     actual_sum = sum(arr) 
     return expected_sum - actual_sum
