CODE1
#Function for given an array arr of integers, find all the elements that occur more than once in the array. If no element repeats, return an empty array.


class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, arr):
        # code here
        from collections import Counter
        counts=Counter(arr)
        result=[key for key, value in counts.items() if value>1]
        return result;




CODE2
#You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

class Solution:
    def leaders(self, arr):
        # code here
      leaders = []
      max_from_right = float('-inf')  # Start with the smallest possible value
    
    # Traverse the array from right to left
      for num in reversed(arr):
         if num >= max_from_right:
            leaders.append(num)
            max_from_right = num  # Update the current leader
    
      
      return leaders[::-1]
